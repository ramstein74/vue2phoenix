## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# kick it!
npm run dev

alongside this folder create a phoenix project called nobvue (no bruch + vue)
the browserify task will look for the  ../nobvue/priv/static/js/app.js folder

adapt it to your needs...

it will recreate the app.js file every time you change your code
For more information see the [docs for vueify](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify).
